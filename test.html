      Patricia's friend who was here hardly had any issues at all, 
      but she wasn't telling the truth. Yesterday, before she left to go home, 
      she heard that her husband is in the hospital and pretended to be surprised.
      It later came out that she was the person who had put him there.
      The tree missed the days the kids used to come by and play.
       It still wore the tire swing the kids had put up in its branches years ago 
       although both the tire and the rope had seen better days. The tree had watched 
       all the kids in the neighborhood grow up and leave, and it wondered if there would 
       ever be a time when another child played and laughed again under its branches. That 
       was the hope that the tree wished every day as the swing gently swung empty in the 
       wind.
